# US Election Sentiment Analysis Project

## Goal
Build, train, test, and deploy a sentiment analysis ML model to predict sentiment trends during the US election period. It includes visual representations of sentiment distribution, temporal trends, and popular topics. Users can explore geographic variations in sentiment, track real-time sentiment changes, and identify influential Twitter users.

## Introduction
Welcome to our US Election Sentiment Analysis project! Our team, comprising Gurpreet D., Ahmed E., Neil G., and Keyana P., embarked on a journey to analyze Twitter sentiments during the pivotal 2020 US election period. Our goal was to uncover sentiment trends, geographic sentiment variations, and the impact of social media on voting behavior, using machine learning models to process and analyze a vast dataset of tweets related to Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

## Dataset
Our analysis is grounded in three comprehensive datasets:
- Two datasets consisting of tweets about Trump and Biden, collected from October 15, 2020, to November 8, 2020.
- Election voting data for 2020, detailing vote counts from each state.

These datasets were sourced from Kaggle and Harvard Dataverse, offering a rich basis for our sentiment analysis.

## Audience and Purpose
This project is designed for a wide audience, including politicians, researchers, journalists, social media users, and the general population. We aim to explore the potential of social media in predicting election outcomes, understanding the impact of social media attention on voting behavior, and providing insights into public sentiment about the elections.

## Technologies Used
Our analysis leveraged powerful tools and libraries in the Python ecosystem:
- **Python:** for general programming needs.
- **NLTK and Vader Lexicon:** for natural language processing.
- **Pandas, MathPlotLib, Seaborn, Plotly:** for data manipulation and visualization.
- **AWS and S3FS:** for cloud storage and computing resources.
- **Word Cloud:** for generating visual representations of text data.

## Model Training and Optimization
We employed a comparison of three ML models:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Ensemble models combining SVM and LSTM predictions through hard and soft voting mechanisms.

These models were optimized for increased accuracy in sentiment prediction, providing nuanced insights into public sentiment during the election.

## Considerations and Limitations
Our project navigated through various considerations and limitations, from data sourcing to model selection. These challenges were addressed through methodical data processing and innovative analytical strategies, ensuring reliable insights.

## Conclusion
Our sentiment analysis project offers a new lens through which to view the 2020 US election, highlighting the power of social media data in understanding public sentiment. We invite questions and discussions about our methodologies, findings, and the broader implications of our work.
